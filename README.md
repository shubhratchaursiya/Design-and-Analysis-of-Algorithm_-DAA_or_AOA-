# 💻 PART 1: DAA PROGRAMS (CODE)

This section contains **C programs implementing standard algorithms** taught in DAA.  
Each program focuses on **time complexity, algorithm design strategy, and correctness**.

---

## 📂 Program List with Description

### 1️⃣ Linear Search
Searches an element by checking each element sequentially.  
Used to explain **basic searching and time complexity O(n)**.

---

### 2️⃣ Binary Search
Searches an element in a sorted array using divide and conquer strategy.  
Demonstrates **logarithmic time complexity O(log n)**.

---

### 3️⃣ Bubble Sort
Sorts elements by repeatedly swapping adjacent elements.  
Used to understand **basic sorting and worst-case complexity O(n²)**.

---

### 4️⃣ Selection Sort
Selects the minimum element and places it in correct position.  
Demonstrates **comparison-based sorting**.

---

### 5️⃣ Insertion Sort
Builds sorted array one element at a time.  
Efficient for **small datasets**.

---

### 6️⃣ Merge Sort
Uses **divide and conquer** to sort elements.  
Demonstrates **stable sorting with O(n log n)** complexity.

---

### 7️⃣ Quick Sort
Partitions array around a pivot element.  
Shows **average-case efficiency and recursion**.

---

### 8️⃣ Fractional Knapsack
Solves optimization problem using **greedy approach**.  
Allows taking fractions of items.

---

### 9️⃣ 0/1 Knapsack
Uses **dynamic programming** to solve optimization problem.  
Items cannot be divided.

---

### 🔟 Fibonacci (Recursive & Iterative)
Generates Fibonacci series.  
Used to compare **recursive vs iterative complexity**.

---

### 1️⃣1️⃣ Matrix Chain Multiplication
Optimizes matrix multiplication order using **dynamic programming**.

---

### 1️⃣2️⃣ N-Queen Problem
Places N queens on chessboard using **backtracking**.

---

### 1️⃣3️⃣ Sum of Subsets
Finds subsets whose sum equals given value.  
Uses **backtracking technique**.

---

### 1️⃣4️⃣ Graph Traversal – BFS
Traverses graph level-wise.  
Uses **queue data structure**.

---

### 1️⃣5️⃣ Graph Traversal – DFS
Traverses graph depth-wise.  
Uses **recursion or stack**.
